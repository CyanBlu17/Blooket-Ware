# Rice-Client
A Client for Blooket and Gimkit (More support on Blooket and not Gimkit), still WIP

How to use: Copy the code from main.js, press Ctrl + Shift + I, then paste in the code, if the code doesn't paste and theres an error message, type in "allow pasting" then try pasting, it should work. To hide the cheats, press Ctrl + Shift + E (will be customizable in the future)

Planning to add to ViolentMonkey for injection.

GUI is based on Rise Client 6 on https://riseclient.com
